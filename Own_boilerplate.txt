Step->1 : Open VScode and goto settings
Step->2 : Goto user snippets
Step->3 : Search and select the language(like c,c++ etc) that you want to create your own boilerplate
Step->4 : Select all the text and delete then, 
Step->5 : Copy and paste the following:-
{
	// Place your snippets for cpp here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"boilerplate": {
		"prefix": "boilerplate code",
		"body": [
			"#include <iostream>",
			"using namespace std;",
			"int main(){",
			"$1",
			"return 0;",
			"}"
		],
		"description": "Log output to console"
	}
}


Step->6 : When you type "boilerplate code" and press enter then automatically your boiler plate gets displayed.
